Okay, so you've decided to translate my program. Great!
It's pretty simple, all you have to do is translate info.txt and strings.h.

First of all, rename the "en-US" directory to your language-territory codes.
In "en-US", the "en" specify the language and the "US" specify the territory.
E.g., here in Sweden we have "sv" for Svenska (the Swedish language) and "SE" for Sweden (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code).
Find your language code at http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php and your territory code at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements

Now that that's taken care of, lets translate!
Open strings.h with a text editor, Notepad works fine.
The first thing you see is a huge comment saying blah blah blah.
Update the text "en-US localization by Stefan Sundin (recover89@gmail.com)" to your language-territory, your name and your email, if you want to be credited.
Scroll past the comment and you'll see a lot of '#define L10N_SOMETHING L"something"'

The first one, with "L10N_FILE_VERSION" says which localization version these strings correspond to.
When I update the program in a way that the strings are no longer compatible, this value will change and your localized version will no longer work.
Don't worry though, if you don't mind, I'll send you an email before I release a version with new strings, giving you plenty of time to translate.
Just leave this value, I'll update it whenever it needs updating.

Lets go down further, now it's time to translate the strings.
Here's an explanation of the strings you'll see:
L10N_MENU_xxx      These strings are the ones in the tray menu.
L10N_TRAY_xxx      These strings are the tooltip for the tray icon. You'll notice that "L10N_NAME" is used here, that will be automatically replaced during compilation.
L10N_BALLOON       The balloon tip which is displayed when ShutdownGuard prevents something.
L10N_VISTA_REASON  The text for the Vista shutdown dialog.
L10N_SHUTDOWN_xxx  The strings in the dialog asking you how you want to shutdown.
L10N_ABOUT_xxx     The about dialog. Replace "XXX (email)" with your name and email, if you want to be credited.

Great, now you've translated the program, now it's time to translate the info.txt file.
Just open up info.txt with Notepad and start translating. Replace "XXX (email)" as usual.
Feel free to use UTF-8 if you need it.
You don't have to translate the changelog, but if you think it would be helpful, you are welcome to do so.

Great, now you're done.
All you have to do is zip the directory and email it to me at recover89@gmail.com.
I will hopefully be able to release the translated version within a few days.
I got a few other programs that you can translate if you wish, take a look at the projects linked to from http://code.google.com/u/recover89/.
