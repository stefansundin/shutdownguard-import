ShutdownGuard
Made by Stefan Sundin

Prevent Windows to shutdown, reboot or log off.
When ShutdownGuard prevents something it will pop up in the tray and ask you if you want to continue.
Middle-click the tray icon to bring up the shutdown dialog.

ShutdownGuard will automatically check for updates.
You can disable this in ShutdownGuard.ini.

You can use -hide as a parameter to hide the tray icon.

Changelog
---------
Customized version:
This customized version is made to more prevent tampering with ShutdownGuard by the user.
Once the tray has been hidden, you must hold the Shift button when attempting shutdown to make the balloon tip show.
You must also hold the Shift button when launching another copy to add the tray icon.
You might want to remove this file so your users won't find that out. :)
Be sure to hide the tray icon on autostart.
Note that Vista can still be easily shutdown, that is beyond my control.
There is nothing to prevent the user from terminating ShutdownGuard from other programs like the Task Manager, you must restrict that on your own.
